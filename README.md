# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was made as a study guide I can use to reference throughout the bootcamp. My motivation was to learn a few details about coding before the bootcamp. It solved my curiosity towards coding and I learned commands, how to use terminal, how to set up and connect desktop and web applications so everything is up to date.
