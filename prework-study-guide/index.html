          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CDD property applied and the value of the property. Ex: declaration (color: blue;) includes the CSS property "color" and the value for that property, "blue"</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li> An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop (let x = 0;), The second statement is the condition (x < shapes.length;), The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item (x++).</li>
